# ways of generating compile command json file
clangd is programming language server of clang, requires a compile_commands.json file located in source code directory for the best. I recommend intercept-build for generating the file, because it is included in clang-tools package when compiling via make and makefile.

* intercept-build make -B
* bear make -B
* compiledb make -B
* meson, cmake
* [codechecker](https://github.com/Ericsson/codechecker/#Install-guide)

or use bash script
```sh
make --always-make --dry-run \
 | grep -wE 'gcc|g\+\+' \
 | grep -w '\-c' \
 | jq -nR '[inputs|{directory:".", command:., file: match(" [^ ]+$").string[1:]}]' \
 > compile_commands.json
```
